<h1> #reddit-anime - Rules and Information </h1>

<h2> Rules </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="color:#FF0000;"><b>Don't Spoil things for people</b></span>. If in doubt, ask first and move it to a query.</li>
        <li>No public away messages. <a href="http://sackheads.org/~bnaylor/spew/away_msgs.html">Learn it, love it.</a></li>
        <li>No excessive usage of /nick (excessive is up to channel ops to define)</li>
        <li>Don't append things to your nick to indicate where you are or what computer you're using. No one cares and it's annoying.</li>
        <li>No threats or personal attacks (the ops have a sense of humor, don't worry)</li>
        <li>When an op tells you do drop a subject, drop it. It's all about keeping harmony.</li>
        <li>English is the preferred language of the channel, but of course there will be incidental Japanese.</li>
    	<li>Don't spam the channel. (Tons of short lines, copypasta, etc.) <i>randum.txt here withstanding - <b>airen</b></i></li>
    	<li>Don't roleplay. Roleplaying is stupid and smacks of Gaia, and Gaia is horrible.</li>
    	<li>Don't ask for ops. Asking for ops is putting on a sign that says "Ban me".</li>
    	<li>Don't use auto re-join. A kick is a timeout (take a moment to reflect on why you were kicked.) Auto-rejoin breaks that. That's asking for a kick to be turned into a ban.</li>
    	<li>If your link isn't safe for work, or is questionable, prepend/append NSFW to your link. Some of us have jobs we'd like to keep.</li>
    	<li>If your link is gore, or is questionable, prepend/append NSFL to your link. Some of us have lunches we'd like to keep.</li>
    	<li>If your link contains spoilers, tell people that a) there are spoilers and b) what they might be spoiling (e.g. http://whatever.com/img.png thing spoilers)</li>
    	<li>Ban evasion will lead to another ban. If you keep trying to join despite being banned, your behavior will be brought up with Freenode staff.</li>
	<li>If you complain about how much you dislike the channel and how much you don't want to be here, you will be given help leaving.</li>
	<li>We are not your personal recommendation service. If all you do is join and ask for recommendations, you're going to have a bad time.</li>
	<li>Don't append things to your nick to indicate team affiliation, holiday celebration, or the like.</li>
	<li>Your droids aren't welcome here. We have one bot and we don't want any more of them.</li>
    </ol>

    If you post spoilers, you'll be banned. From the channel <b>and</b> from /r/anime. Simple as that. No second chances.<br />
    Fake spoilers are still spoilers. The ops can't watch every show and know what's contextual or not. Don't fake spoil things either.<br />
    Spoilers for things that aren't anime are still spoilers.<br />
    There is no expiration period for spoilers. Old spoilers are still spoilers<br />
    Don't hide your spoilers with colors. Not all IRC clients will support that. <b>Just don't spoil things.</b><br />
    Have thick skin. We joke around a lot. That doesn't mean abuse is okay though, if you feel abused, report it to a channel op.<br />
    This list of rules is not exhaustive and if the channel ops deem any behavior unacceptable they can and will take action.<br />
