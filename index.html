<h1> ##weeabros - Rules and Information </h1>

<h2> Rules </h2>
	<ol>
		<li><span style="color:#FF0000;"><b>Don't Spoil things for people</b></span>. If in doubt, ask first and move it to a query.</li>
		<li>No public away messages. <a href="http://sackheads.org/~bnaylor/spew/away_msgs.html">Learn it, love it.</a></li>
		<li>No excessive usage of /nick (excessive is up to channel ops to define)</li>
		<li>Don't append things to your nick to indicate where you are, what computer you're using, team affiliation, holiday celebration, etc.</li>
		<li>No threats, personal attacks, or encouraging suicide (the ops have a sense of humor, don't worry)</li>
		<li>When an op tells you to drop a subject, drop it. It's all about keeping harmony.</li>
		<li>Don't spam the channel. (Tons of short lines, copypasta, etc.)
		<li>Don't roleplay.</li>
		<li>If your link isn't safe for work, or is questionable, prepend/append NSFW to your link. Some of us have jobs we'd like to keep.</li>
		<li>If your link is gore, or is questionable, prepend/append NSFL to your link. Some of us have lunches we'd like to keep.</li>
		<li>If your link contains spoilers, tell people that a) there are spoilers and b) what they might be spoiling (e.g. http://whatever.com/img.png thing spoilers)</li>
		<li>Ban evasion will lead to another, <i>longer</i> ban. If you keep trying to join despite being banned, your behavior will be brought up with Freenode staff.</li>
		<li>If you complain about how much you dislike the channel and how much you don't want to be here, you will be given help leaving.</li>
		<li>Your droids aren't welcome here. We have one bot and we don't want any more of them.</li>
	</ol>

<h3> Spoilers are verboten </h3>
	If you post spoilers, you'll be banned. Simple as that. No second chances.<br />
	Fake spoilers are still spoilers. The ops can't watch every show and know what's contextual or not. Don't fake spoil things either.<br />
	There is no expiration period for spoilers. Old spoilers are still spoilers<br />
	Don't hide your spoilers with colors. Not all IRC clients will support that. <b>Just don't spoil things.</b><br />

<h3> Memes </h3>
	Don't import your memes here en masse. The point of this channel is communication, not spamming people with the latest internet trend.

<h3> Invitations </h3>
	This is a not a private channel, but it also isn't advertised. Feel free to invite people, but if they make trouble, you'll be held
	accountable for their actions.<br />

	Use your judgment.

<h3> Last but not least </h3>
	Have thick skin. We joke around a lot. That doesn't mean abuse is okay though, if you feel abused, report it to a channel op.<br />
	This list of rules is not exhaustive and if the channel ops deem any behavior unacceptable they can and will take action.<br />
